# Credit Card Comparer Tool!

Tool is currently deployed online at: https://cc-comparer-tool.netlify.com/

Or if you prefer, you can clone this repo and run it on your own hardware.

# WHY?

This program was written to allow quick, easy and objective to comparison of various rewards earning credit cards that may consist of complex earning categories.

## Credit Cards carry big risks:

Rewards credit cards can be provide great value but they also carry many drawbacks:

-Annual fees of up to $550+ per year.

-Complex earning structures (1 point everywhere, 4 points at grocery stores, 4 points on dining, 3 points airfare). 

-Paying out of this world interest rates of 20%+ can lead to vicious cycles of increasing debt.

-Survey after survey shows that Americans spend more money when they use a credit card compared to cash.   

-Rewards credit cards can confuse even the more saavy because of the difficulty in ascertaining the value on what one "point" or one "mile" is actually worth. For example, most affiliate based travel blogs typically recommend paying your taxes with a credit card which comes at a fee of ~2-2.5% in order to get more rewards.

>Assuming you use a regular airline credit, to pay a tax bill of $1,000, you would be in effect buying miles at 1,000 per $25. Given that airline miles generally don't break ~1.4-1.5 cents per point you are buying $14-$15 worth of airline miles for $25. That is a rip off!         


## The Goal here is to help you answer these questions relatively quickly and easily: 

-Are you getting more than the $450 fee worth of value out of your Chase Sapphire Reserve Card (CSR)?

-What if you used XYZ credit card instead? 

-What if you just used a simple 2% cashback everywhere card, would you lose out any money at all?

-Or if you're paying interest, you would be better off not using a credit card at all! 

# How To Use:

-When loaded, the tool will display a sample credit card.

-Make a name (or use default names)

-Enter an approximate value of each point (it is recommend to not exceed ~1.5 cents per point in value here unless you know what you are doing). If using cashback, simply write 1.

## It is recommended that the initial card be a flat 2% cashback card (no bonus categories) which contains all of your esimated yearly spending.

-This will generate an approximate value in cash of how much money you will earn from using that (e.g $25,000 per year at 2% = $500 cashback).

-After establishing a baseline, you can add up to 3 additional cards to see whether or not they offer any value.

-Don't forget to include annual fees and other potential value from benefits such as checked bags but **when in doubt, aim to be conservative - the banks want you to overvalue the benefits**.
