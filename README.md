# Credit Card Comparer Tool!

Tool is not (currently) deployed online but can be ran in an IDE by downloading or cloning this repo and runing "npm start".

## WHY?

This program was written to allow quick, easy and objective to comparison of various rewards earning credit cards that may consist of complex earning categories.

# Credit Cards carry big risks:

Rewards credit cards can be provide great value but they also carry many drawbacks:

-Annual fees of up to $550+ per year.

-Complex earning structures (1 point everywhere, 4 points at grocery stores, 4 points on dining, 3 points airfare). 

-Paying out of this world interest rates of 20%+ can lead to vicious cycles of increasing debt.

-Survey after survey shows that Americans spend more money when they use a credit card compared to cash.   

-Rewards credit cards can confuse even the more saavy because of the difficulty in ascertaining the value on what one "point" or one "mile" is actually worth. For example, most affiliate based travel blogs typically recommend paying your taxes with a credit card which comes at a fee of ~2-2.5% in order to get more rewards.

>Assuming you use a regular airline credit, to pay a tax bill of $1,000, you would be in effect buying miles at 1,000 per $25. Given that airline miles generally don't break ~1.4-1.5 cents per point you are buying $14-$15 worth of airline miles for $25. That is a rip off!         


## The Goal here is to help you answer these questions relatively quickly and easily: 

-Are you getting more than the $450 fee worth of value out of your Chase Sapphire Reserve Card (CSR)?

-What if you used XYZ credit card instead? 

-What if you just used a simple 2% cashback everywhere card, would you lose out any money at all?

-Or if you're paying interest, you would be better off not using a credit card at all!
